Why did you resigned from ur previous company ???

I joined that company as a fresher so I learnt many things like team work,working under pressure, punctuality , a way of working in an industry.Now I'm looking for new challenges which will increase my knowledge and confidence. According to me job change is necessary to enhance our skills, knowledge and for personal growth as well as financial growth, and I hope your organisation is the best platform to learn and grow with in it.


May I contact your present employer for a reference?

Yes, sir. Why not? It's a pleasure for me. But sir I would request you once I got shortlist in your company then you may contact with them because they are not aware of that I am looking for a change and I will be glad to share contact details of the respective person of my organization, which I am currently working for. I'm sure you will know good words about me.


tell me strong as well as weak points of ur previous boss ? 

Strong points are my manager is self-motivated and highly particular and determined and team friendly.
"a coin has both sides" in the same way everyone has weak points also but I can't say weak points because I am not the right person to comment on his weak points so it's always better to take positive and move on.
He is a manager, he thinks of you and company as well.

Why should I hire you from the outside when I could promote someone from within?
Yes you can promote someone internally but 
You should hire me from the outside because I might bring fresh ideas and I have a unique and creative approach to any task I undertake. Every company needs creativity.
